          This is in some ways a very personal piece for me. Commissioned by birdwatcher Vibeke Steinsholm on behalf of <a href="https://www.verdensarvvega.no/en/home">Vega Verdensarvsenter</a>
          I was asked to make a "mass for the homecoming of birds"
          for recitor, electronics and a group of 5-8 children. The birds and area in question is my home-disctrict in Norway called "Sør-Helgeland", and I were to use sounds from the birds
          I grew up hearing on the island of Vega where my father is from and its surrounding ocean of smaller islands.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a way of starting off the project, I was invited to visit a small group of islands outside Vega called "Hysværet" and stay there for some days to experience the environment, listen to and
          record birdsong. I quickly became interested in the idea creating a pseudo-mythology for the islands which included a creation-myth explaning birds and their spiritual role in this island-world.
          I didn't end up creating an elaborate myth with texts about creation and so on, but these ideas and images of birds having a spiritual role stayed with me and became very important when I started
          composing with their sounds in the electronics and the material for the children's choir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then after having struggled for some months to create or find the appropriate text for the piece myself, me and Vibeke agreed upon contacting poet <a href="https://snl.no/Rawdna_Carita_Eira">Rawdna Carita Eira</a>
          to write the text for the piece in both Northern-Norwegian and the almost extinct language of South-Sami. From here on the compositional process could really start.
