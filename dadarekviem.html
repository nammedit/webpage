      <div class="blogtext">

          Dada-rekviem is another work for the new-music-trio Mujic Footure written for countertenor, piano and compouter-controlled synthesizer. The piece is based around the traditional requiem
          and contains six of the traditional sections from the original mass: Introitus, Kyrie, Sequencia (with three sub-sections Dies Irae, Tuba Mirum and Lacrimosa), Sanctus, Pie Jesu and In Paradisum.
          The text for the piece is a computer generated stream-of-consciousness-like flow of words generated from modulating the probability for choice of the next letter between several sources:
          Jame Joyce' Finnegans Wake, the original Latin requiem texts, and sets of letters to generate "noise". The countertenor typically sings the text if it leans towards the Latin source,
          Finnegans Wake is typically spoken and everything in between is a mix of singing and speaking, or even going gradually from singing to speaking and vice versa.
          The synthesizer does a similar play of "choice", modulating its choice of notes and durations between noise, sequences or reservoars of values. And the piano-part is largely improvised by
          myself at the piano.

          The piece opens with the text "Rice-man G-tornalis", an improvised alteration of "Requiem Aeternam", and is one of two places in the piece where I use my own original text. The musical notation
          is "free", meaning exact duration and placement of events between the instruments are up to the performers.
          The notes and durations in this movenent comes from an improvised "block" of music which is repeated
          four times, each time being compressed more and more in time and detail as it starts again.
          As a contrast to the "free" notation mentioned above, the movement has three moments of contrapunctal writing where the musicians have a set tempo. These moments of
          contrasting strictness in my opinion establishes a duality that is important for the rest of the piece between an improvisatory flow of time, and a precise flow of time.

          After a tail based on the text of "Lux Aeterna" the piece starts a large global transformation throughout the Kyrie towards the most chaotic and fragmented part of the piece: the Dies Irae.
          Here the text is largely generated from random choice of consonants with an occasional tilt towards Joyce or the Latin Dies Irae text. The synthesizer-part is also here at its most chaotic
          behaviour, modulating even parameters of the quality of the sound in a chaotic manner, while the piano oscillates between a romantic-like flow notes and smashing the piano with flat hands.

          The piece reaches a turning point after having desintegrated totally at the end of the Lacrimosa, and the Sanctus slowly starts to "awaken" from the ashes. The Sanctus is the second place in
          the piece where I use my own original text. This text is first spoken in a mumbling, "sleepy" low-pitched voice over a movement of piano music growing slowly in intensity.

          Even at an early point in composing this piece I knew I would make the "Hosanna In Excelsis" of the latter part in the Sanctus an important climatic moment, inspired by Gabriel Faure's powerful and
          triumphant version in his Requiem. At some point I altered the text "Hosanna In Excelsis" by removing "Hosanna" completely and making "Excelsis" into "Extasis", tilting the meaning of the original
          statement from something joyfull into something more of an "overdrive"-like emotional state. Besides from just instinctively liking this alteration, I've been trying to ponder how it can be
          interpreted in a symbolic sense. In relation to the next section (Pie Jesu), which is the only section fully using the unaltered Latin text, it can be viewed as a state that is "too high", like
          someone who overaims and becomes cocky in the search of God. The sincere Pie Jesu with its straightforwardness and unaltered text is almost like a calming down and coming back to reality
          and God after having over-extended. This is one possible interpretation.

          After Pie Jesu the piece enters, or rather, ascends into the last section of In Paradisum. To reach this section the Amen concluding the Pie Jesu becomes a repeating mantra rising in register towards
          the top of the countertenor's range. Simultaneously, the piano initiates an upwards drift of notes that turns into cascades of notes flowing upwards and starting again at the
          bottom as soon as they hit the top register of the piano. Towards the end these cascades turn into a looping onstinato reflecting the opening lines from FW used in this section:
          "..riverrun past Eve and Adams, brings us by a commodius recirculation back to Howth Castle and environs..". This text
          seamlessly connects to the last words of FW, making it at least possible to interpret the work as cyclic. Cyclic or not I wanted to use this cyclic idea in my interpratation of Paradise, not viewing
          it as some sort of end-station where one spends eternity in bliss, but rather as an eternal paralell "state".
          Then how to end if Paradise is not an end-station but something simultaneous and ever-abiding? I think I used some days to ponder the ending, but ended up writing five long stretched out
          Amens over the piano ostinato, as you do to end a piece of "religious" music.
