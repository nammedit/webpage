        Martin Tidemann Kvalø is a Norwegian composer working with instrumentations mixing electronic and acoustical instruments and sounds. Using self-authored algorithmic tools coupled with an improvisational apporach to composing, Kvalø searches for the other-worldly, the alien and at the same time strangely familiar in his music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martin is also a composer and performer of electronics in the new-music-trio Mujic Footure together with countertenor Sean Bell and pianist Eirik Hellerdal Fosstveit. They will perform his newest piece “Genesis/Paradiso” in concerts fall 2023, and make a record sometime in 2024 including an older piece for the group (“Dada-rekviem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Kvalø has recently been admitted to the Master’s programme in composition at the Norwegian Academy of music and will start his studies in august 2023 working on hybrid compositional processes between the intuitive and the algorithmic to facilitate complexity and emergence in his music.
