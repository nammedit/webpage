      <p class="blogtitle">Genesis/Paradiso</p>
      <div class="blogtext">
        <p>Genesis/Paradiso is a piece for the new-music-trio Mujic Footure consinsting of countertenor <a href="https://seanbell.no/">Sean Bell</a>, pianist Eirik Hellerdal Fosstveit and
        myself.
        The inspiration for this piece came from a fascination with the "ultimate", as described across cultures and authors: Paradise/Gnosis in Christian culture, Nirvana in Buddhism, Satori in Zen Buddhism, full integration of the psyche in Carl Jung and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          However as a main inspiration for this piece I read and was very fascinated with Dante Alighieri's Paradiso, where Dante journeys through the nine orders of heaven before reaching the Empyrean where God resides.
          I knew I somehow wanted to use ideas or elements from the book in my piece, while avoiding programmatic musicmaking. At first I tried resisting doing the simplest thing of all: structuring my piece using nine "orders", or sections.
          After sometime I of course ended up doing just that, and also got the idea that I would mirror the whole piece at the center, referencing the idea of the "center" being connected to the idea of God, and also God himself being a mirror reflecting reality.

          For a while after this point I thought the piece would be a "Formula-piece" inspired
          Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Formelkomposition". I found ways of generating pitch-material, harmonizations, section-lenghts, tempos, durations and even words all from the number sequence 1 .. 9. Each section would be created from small cells where intervals in the motives and lengths of durations inside the cells would sum up to the "number" assigned to the section.
          First every cell would sum up to 1, leaving just a long single note on a single vowel-sound. Then 2, creating a tremolo movement between two notes with the possibility of the rythmic relationship 1:2 or 2:1. Then 3, 4, 5 etc. using the same rules.
          After a while however, improvisatory ideas emerged that were more convincing than the results from the formula, and a hybrid process of following my improvisational instinct while simultaneously trying to make it at least vaguely fit the formula started.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, since the process after this point was much more hazy, I vaguely kept the formula using it more as a point of reference for my intuition to come back to. I even ended up mirroring the piece, but in a much more free manner than I imagined at first.
          Maybe this duality of formula and intuition is reflected in the title somehow? I'm still not entirely sure why the piece is called Genesis/Paradiso and not just Paradiso, but the former feels more right.
          In a way I started out following the formula rigidly and then freeing myself more and more from it, then coming back to the planned endpoint of the single note I started with but from a different angle than expected.
          Towards the end of skecthing the piece, the idea of the vortex emerged - yet another image embodying a center. Reflecting back on the piece now after it's been sketched I can see the "Genesis" part of the title making sense in that the first half of the piece "expands" from singular points, and that the other half contracts the massive back to the singular again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Where then is the "Paradiso" part of the title found in the piece? I think of the idea of Paradise representing the absolutely singular, the infinitely massive and the unity between the two. An image that always stayed with me during the composing of this piece was
          Gustavo Dore's drawing of the Empyrean as a circular shining mass consinting of millions of angles floating/rotating around the center/God. This image heavily influenced the textures that I've tried to create in this piece, and especially
          in the writing of the live-electronics part. The electronics uses a bank of recordings of single organ-notes held for 10 seconds to create a simple sample-instrument that is controlled through generative algorithms in Supercollider.
          A related process is used for the countertenor, recording Sean's voice for instance chanting on different notes with different words at different speeds, and then layering sets of these recordings to create thick voice-textures.
          Sometimes one can hear up to fifty singular voices meandering around with algorithmic rules for choice of scale & degree, fading in and out of audible amplitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then maybe, if I were to make an interpretation of my own title in hindsight, I'd say it suggests that there's an interconnectedness between the absolute and the wordly, between Paradise and Creation and how they're two aspects of the same process.
